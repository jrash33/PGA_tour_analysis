# PGA_tour_analysis

Python Flask powered HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB to visualize PGA tour data off the tee for the last 40 years. Because data is called from local database, the final product can be seen at: https://jrash33.github.io/PGA_Viz_Crossfilter_D3/index.html

This repository has the same final product but calls data from data files instead of local database.
